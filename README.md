# Survivor

With this project this is my attempt at making a Video Game in the Unity engine

This game you will have your player avoid obstacles such as zombies and walls that can trap you. 
You can break these walls but it takes turns to break the walls so tread lightly. 
You can survive by collecting soda and food to restore your life points. 
Once you reach 0 the game is over. 
Try and beat your high score.
